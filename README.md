#0x11. C - printf
##This is a group alx project to write a personal printf function. Project was done by Bright Sefah and Gilbert Henyo

##Introduction to printf and its purpose:
        printf is a function in C used for formatted output.
        It allows you to print various types of data (integers, floats, characters, strings, etc.) with specific formatting.
        The formatting is controlled by a format string that specifies placeholders for data and formatting options.


##Format strings and placeholders:
        A format string is a string containing format specifiers and optional text.
        Format specifiers are placeholders for data and start with a '%' character, followed by a character indicating the type of data to print (e.g., %d for integers).
        You can include regular characters in the format string, which will be printed as-is.


##Variadic arguments:
        printf accepts a variable number of arguments.
        It uses variadic functions, indicated by ... in the function signature.
        Variadic functions allow you to pass a variable number of arguments of different types.


##Parsing the format string:
        printf processes the format string character by character.
        When it encounters '%' followed by a format specifier, it knows what type of data to expect.
        It extracts arguments based on the format specifier and converts them to the specified type.


##Handling different format specifiers:
        printf supports various format specifiers (e.g., %d for integers, %f for floats, %c for characters, %s for strings).
        Each format specifier has its own rules for extracting and formatting data.


##Printing output:
        printf builds the output string based on the format specifiers and arguments.
        It sends the formatted string to the standard output (usually the console).


##Handling modifiers and flags:
        Format specifiers can have optional modifiers and flags (e.g., %04d to print integers with zero-padding).
        Modifiers affect the width, precision, and other formatting options.

##Error handling:
        printf handles various error cases, such as mismatched format specifiers and arguments.
        It returns the number of characters written (excluding the null-terminator) or a negative value on error.
